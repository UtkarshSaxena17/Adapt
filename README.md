This ML project predicts diabetes progression using scikit-learn's load_diabetes dataset. It compares ensemble techniques with a Decision Tree. The model predicts quantitative disease progression, evaluated by MSE and R-squared. RandomizedSearchCV and cross-validation are used for hyperparameter tuning and robust evaluation.
